# PoorKoi2

Hi, HLB team Here !

In 2024 we ran our first public group-buy with the PoorKoi 1, an acrylic stacked keyboard. 30 happy users were very surprised by the clack of this simple 60% made with love. This was our first project, mistakes were made, but we learned a lot and we got confident that we could push even further: having the same thing in a cnc'd polycarbonate version!

We are aiming for the same clack and feeling with the polycarbonate version – with an affordable price. No brass weight or copper that are expensive if you don't sell 200 units. Simple design with references of the v1.

We had to make a stand between affordability and customization, that’s why the standard version will be full polycarbonate – but extra aluminium top will be available for purchase during the group-buy.
We were able to order 5 prototypes from a trusty and hight quality manufacturer – DDS while upgrading our game : laser cut Poron gaskets, custom carrying case, in house hotswap pcb (as well as new solder one) !
